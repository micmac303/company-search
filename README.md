Company Search Service (Developer test for Trunarrative) 

## Running the application
./gradlew bootRun

### Development notes
RestTemplateBuilder creates thread safe RestTemplate instances.
HttpServerErrorException ?
API Key as a parameter in the request so that it is not added to the git repository.
Records instead of Classes?
Something better than get(0) ?
